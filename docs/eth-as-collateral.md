One limitation of the Synthetix system is that the total value of all synthetics is capped by the SNX token itself. As of November 2019, the SNX market cap is about $150 million. At a 750% `C-RATIO`, the maximum synthetics value is about $20 million. Up-to-date stats are available on <a href="https://dashboard.synthetix.io/" class="link" target="_blank">Dashboard</a>


The community is discussing the idea of adding ETH as an alternate collateral type in order to extend the liquidity and accessibility of the system.

There was a <a href="https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix/issues/232" target="_blank" class="link">lengthy discussion</a> of the pros and cons on the Synthetix Github issues page.

Crucially, ETH collateral stakers will not be eligible for staking rewards. Fees will be directed into the SNX stakers rewards pool.
