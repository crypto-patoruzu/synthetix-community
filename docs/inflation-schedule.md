To bootstrap the network early on, the Synthetix team implemented a high incentive inflation model, designed to attract capital and promote staking. More on Synthetix's monetary policy and the decision-making process <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://blog.synthetix.io/synthetix-monetary-policy-changes/">here</a>. 

In March 2020, at the end of the first year of this policy, inflation is due to decline from a 75% annualized rate to a 21% annualized rate. However, there is currently <a href="https://github.com/Synthetixio/SIPs/issues/36" target="_blank" class="link">an ongoing discussion</a> to smooth out inflation starting in late 2019, until the end of the current schedule in 2024. 

There isn't currently a consensus on the network's terminal inflation rate, effective in March 2024, but some have discussed a rate in the range of 2-3%. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1x2YB-JfKqzzhTgQasAhX1S-VWG2yJlKFkaHzVubhGtk/edit#gid=51157619" class="link" target="_blank">See a potential inflation model here</a>
